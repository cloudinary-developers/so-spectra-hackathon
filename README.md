# Spectra Hackathon

### Exploring the Tech Space Together

Spectra is an organization that hosts bi-annual, full-day events on the west coast for women in tech. Mostly recently, we hosted a womenâ€™s hackathon at YouTube HQ in July 2016.

We are passionate about bringing together female students and professionals in tech from all around the world. Our events offer attendees a safe and inviting environment to experiment with technology at any experience level.

We believe that every woman should have the opportunity to excel in computer science and strengthen her technical abilities. The Spectra team invites you to come learn new skills, inspire one another, and build long-lasting connections at Spectra.
